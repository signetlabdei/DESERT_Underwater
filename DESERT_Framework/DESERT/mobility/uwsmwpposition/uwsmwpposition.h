 * \brief Provides the definition of the class <i>UWSMWPPosition</i>.
 *
 * Provides the definition of the class <i>UWSMWPPosition</i>.
 * This class implements the a simple movement behaviour: it is possible to
 * define the direction and the speed of the linear movement thanks to a TCL 
 * command in which the user has to define the destination point an the 
 * speed of the movement required. Additionally, this class supports the 
 * addition of a list of waypoints to reach sequentially.
 * NOTE: the destination point is used to define the direction od the node and
 * when it is reached the node will proceed for the same direction
 *
 * @see NodeCore, Position
