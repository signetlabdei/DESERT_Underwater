# ROS Integration for DESERT

## ROS middleware

The DESERT framework can be combined with an easy-to-use and efficient ROS middleware module that enables robotic applications to communicate through an underwater acoustic channel by leveraging the DESERT protocol stack. With a specific focus on the unique characteristics of underwater networks, this module provides an open-source interface that can be used for any robotic project involving submerged devices.

While the ROS ecosystem has seen the implementation of various Data Distribution Services for inter-node communication, none of them are inherently suitable for the specific challenges of acoustic transmission. The goal of this integration is to expand the potential of the ROS framework to new application scenarios, and more detailed information and usage instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/signetlabdei/rmw_desert/wiki).

This middleware, provides:
- A communication bridge between ROS applications and underwater acoustic networks via DESERT protocols,
- Simplifies the development of underwater robotic applications integrated with DESERT,
- Offers a flexible and open-source interface for various types of automated underwater projects,
- Bridges the gap between traditional ROS DDS and the unique requirements of underwater acoustic communication,
- Expands the possibilities for using ROS in marine and underwater environments.
